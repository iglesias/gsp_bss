# Blind Demixing of Sparse Signals Diffused on Graphs

MATLAB solver for blind separation of sparse signals diffused on graphs. [1]

Diffusion of signals defined on the nodes of a graph is a generalization of the convolution from classical signal processing. [2] [3]

## ICASSP 2018

### Scenario 1. Single random graph (multiple diffusing filters on the same graph).

```Matlab
>> addpath('experiment_singlegraph_bss_logdet')
>> singlegraph_bss_logdet_N_S_numFilters
>> % Long for 1000 simulations!
>> Alternative: use pre-generated mat files in experiment_singlegraph_bss_logdet.

>> % Crunch data from mat files and produce mean and median RMSE plots.
>> cd experiment_singlegraph_bss_logdet
>> analysis_singlegraph_bss_logdet
```

### Scenario 2. Two coupled random graphs.
TODO

### Scenario 3. Multiple brain graphs.

```Matlab
>> addpath('experiment_brain_bss_logdet')
>> brain_bss_logdet_S_numGraphs
>> % Very long for 1000 simulations!
>> Alternative: use pre-generated mat files in experiment_brain_bss_logdet.

>> % Produce plot.
>> cd experiment_brain_bss_logdet
>> brain_bss_logdet_S_numGraphs_figure
```
